### **Project Overview: Static Web Hosting on AWS with Terraform & GitHub Actions**

 This comprehensive a multi-series, Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD automation project. It is designed to simplify and accelerate your learning of deploying secure, scalable static websites on AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

Youâ€™ll build a complete AWS-based web infrastructure from scratchâ€”covering DNS, SSL, S3 website hosting, and CloudFront CDNâ€”while mastering modular Terraform design and automation practices.

---

### **What Youâ€™ll Learn?**

* **Deploy end-to-end AWS infrastructure** using reusable Terraform modules
* **Manage DNS and SSL** with Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager
* **Host and serve content** from S3 with custom domain support
* **Distribute content globally** using Amazon CloudFront
* **Automate deployments** using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines

---

### **Included Terraform Modules**

This project is organized into four core Terraform modules:

1. **S3 Remote Backend** â€“ For state management with Amazon S3 & DynamoDB
2. **DNS & SSL Management** â€“ Using Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
3. **S3 Static Website Hosting** â€“ Secure and scalable content storage
4. **CloudFront CDN Configuration** â€“ Accelerated content delivery & cache control

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

You'll implement a GitHub Actions workflow that automates:

* **Infrastructure provisioning** with Terraform
* **Content syncing** to S3 buckets
* **Cache invalidation** on CloudFront

Every time you push a change to your repository, this CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys your infrastructure and syncs the latest contentâ€”ensuring your website stays up to date without manual intervention.
